                <p>We are a group of professionals based in Canada, USA and Pakistan. We spent years doing research on technologies related to cyber presence, online business models, marketing structures and strategies, and cyber security.</p>
                <p>We found the cyber space swarmed with thousands of service providers for web hosting, website development, content management, web-based applications and marketing. These range from so-called free (often spammy) to expensive, solid platforms. However, the market is like a jungle — full of confusing, misleading bundles and options. More importantly, there is hardly any provider who offers genuine support.</p>

                <p>We started <strong>Easy Jungle</strong> with all our research and experience behind us, partnering with top resources in computing, web servers, domain registrars, and security providers.</p>
